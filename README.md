## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, having the right tools is essential for success. Our study group aims to explore these tools, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects that enhance our understanding of AI development. 

This repository is designed to provide resources, guides, and examples that will help both newcomers and experienced developers navigate the complex landscape of AI technologies.

## Topics Covered

This repository focuses on several key areas:

- **Agents**: Learn about intelligent agents and their applications in AI.
- **AI Development**: Explore various frameworks and libraries that facilitate AI development.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Understand the techniques for fine-tuning models to improve performance.
- **Generative AI (GenAI)**: Dive into the world of generative models and their potential.
- **LangChain**: Discover how LangChain can be used to build applications with LLMs.
- **Large Language Models (LLM)**: Study the architecture and functionality of LLMs.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Gain insights into MCP and its role in agent architectures.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Learn how RAG enhances generative models by incorporating external knowledge.
